About me:

  I'm a college student skilled in Python programming, music creation, game development, video editing, and basic server management. My Python expertise involves crafting games and data processing scripts, while my music creation showcases a deep understanding of theory and production. In game development, I've gained insights into design and user experience, coupled with my proficiency in video editing for entertaining content.
