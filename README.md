What is Space Yeti Studios?
Space Yeti Studios makes games, in-game content, and even music! Our projects are mostly just hobby projects, freely available to you to use or play!

If your content is free, how do you make money?
We make money from our music on Spotify, iTunes, Apple Music, and Amazon Music, though most of our projects are just hobby projects. We are funded by Donations as well! If you want to see more projects from Space Yeti Studios, you can donate here! We also have our new merch store for Space Yeti Music! You can check it out here!

Why aren't there any ads or cookies?
Space Yeti Studios is dedicated to keeping your privacy yours. We also want to keep our services ad free and will never show third party ads in any of our projects! (We will only advertise our other projects!)
